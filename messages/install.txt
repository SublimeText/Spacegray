Thanks for installing Spacegray!

To select a theme call _UI: Select Theme_ from Command Palette.

To select a color scheme call _UI: Select Color Scheme_ from Command Palette.

Spacegray comes in different flavors, based on Base16 color schemes.
You can choose whichever flavor you like, but don't forget to change *both*
color scheme and UI theme so they match.
